# Capstone Project 2 - Task Manager

In this project, the aim was to use lists or dictionaries and functions to extend the
functionality of a simple task management system. The program is designed for
a small business to help it manage tasks assigned to each member of a team.

The project was designed to consolidate my learning to date on the HyperionDev: Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering (Fundamentals), particularly around lists, functions and string handling. It also aimed to assess my ability to refactor code.

This program is written in Python.

The files in this repository include the Task Manager python file (task_manager.py), and text files for tasks (tasks.txt) and users (user.txt). Downloading the text files is optional: they are intended as examples only.
